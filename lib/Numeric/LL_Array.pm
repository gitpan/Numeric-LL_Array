=head1 NAME

Numeric::LL_Array - Perl extension for low level operations over numeric arrays.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Numeric::LL_Array;
  blah blah blah

=head1 DESCRIPTION

One of the principal overheads of using Perl for numeric vector calculations
is the need to constantly create and destroy a large amount of Perl values
(there is no such overhead in calculations over scalars, since Perl knows how
to reuse implicit temporary variables).

Thus, in this package, we provide a way to manipulate vectors "in
place" without creation of new Perl values.  Additionally, the
calculations over slots in a vector are performed in C, thus
significantly reducing overhead of Perl over C (which, for I<literal>
translation from C to Perl, is of order 80..200 times).

One of the design goals is that many vectors should be able to use the
same C array (e.g., of type double[]) - possibly with offset and a
stride, so performing an operation over a I<subarray> does not require
a new allocation.  The C array is stored in PVX of a Perl variable, so
it may be (eventually) refcounted in the usual Perlish way.

=head2 Playgrounds and layout of strides

A I<playground> is just (a region in) a Perl string, with the buffer
propertly alighed to keep a massive of a certain C type.  This way, one gets,
e.g., C<unsigned char>-playground, or C<long double>-playground, etc.; we
call this C type the I<flavor> of the playground.  One describes a certain
position in the playground in units of the size of the corresponding C type;
e.g., position 3 in C<double> array would typically be at offset of 24 bytes
from the start of playground.

A multi-dimensional array of size C<SIZE1 x SIZE2 x ... x SIZEn> may be
placed into a playground in many different ways; we allow modification of
the I<start position> (the position of the element with index (0,0,...,0)),
and of I<strides>.  There is one stride per dimension of array; the stride
describes how the position of the element changes when one increments the
index by 1 in the particular coordinate in the array.

For example, the array C<0..4> with start 3 and stride 2 occupies the
following positions in the playground:

 content   * * * 0 * 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 ...
 position  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 .......

Note that when plotting this picture one does not care about the flavor of
the playground.

Likewise, the 2-dimensional array with contents

  11 12 13 14
  21 22 23 24

and start 1, horizontal stride 2, and vertical stride 3 takes these positions;

  * 11 * 12 21 13 22 14 23 * 24 ....

and with start 12, horizontal stride -1, and vertical stride -5 takes

  *  *  *  * 24 23 22 21  * 14 13 12 11 ...
  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 ...

The major advantage of this flexibility is that one can work with subarrays
of the given array, with the transposed array, and with the reflected array
without reshuffling I<the content of the array>, but with only changes
in the start position and in the strides.  For example, to access the
transposed 2-dimensional array, one just accesses the same data with 2 strides
interchanged.  Likewise, by decreasing I<dimension>, one can assess columns
and row of the matrix without moving the contents.

Other examples: one can fit C<N x M x K> 0-array into playground of size 1
using strides 0,0,0.  And one can fit C<N x N> identity matrix into a
playground of size C<2N-1> by using strides 1,-1.

=head2 Encoding format of an array

To completely specify an array to the API of this module one needs to
provide the C type, the playground of the array, the start offset, its
I<dimension> (e.g., 1 for vectors, 2 for matrices etc), and its
I<format>, which is the list of the sizes of the array in each
particular direction, and the corresponding strides, in the order
C<STRIDE1 COUNT1 STRIDE2 COUNT2 ...>.  To avoid confusion, it makes
sense to use the name I<arity> for the number I<dimension>, and use
word I<dimensions> for the list C<COUNT1 COUNT2 ... COUNTn> (here C<n> is
the "arity").

The format may be encoded as a list reference, or as a packed list of
C values of type C<ptrdiff_t>.  It is I<not> required that the list contains
exaclty C<2*dimension> elements; it may contain more, and the rest is
ignored.  This way, one can access rows of matrices without copying the
content of the matrix, I<and> without touching the format of the matrix -
only by decreasing dimension and modifying the starting position.

Note that the flavor of the array is not a part of the format.  For
this low-level API, each function is designed to work only with a
certain flavor an array (e.g., if operating on 3 arrays, it assumes 3
particular flavors, one for each of 3 arguments); so given a
particular function, the required flavor of the argument is fully
described by its position in the argument list.  (There is no
error-checking in this regard, it is the caller's responsibility to
follow flavors correctly.)  So the flavors are, essentially, encoded
in the name of the function.

For example, a function for high-level semantic C<add_assign($target,
$source)> (implementing operation C<$target += $source>), can take
arguments

  source_playground, target_playground, dim, start_source, start_target,
       format_source, format_target

E.g., for $target of type C<double>, and source of type C<unsigned
short>, the name of the function may encode letters C<"d"> and C<"S">
(in analogy to Perl C<pack> formats).  (The actual name used is
C<S2d1_add_assign>, see L<"Naming conventions for handlers">.)

The semantic of this module is that it is the I<target> dimensions
which are assumed to be used; so from the source format only the
strides is used, and the C<COUNTn> positions are ignored.  Likewise,
the arity dim is assumed to be common for arrays, and both formats
should contain at least C<2*dimension> elements.

=head2 The accessors

Accessor handlers take the following arguments (with defaults indicated):

 @a = access_T($p, $offset = 0, $dim = 0, $format = undef,
	       $in = undef, $keep = FALSE);

extracts a slice of playground $p into Perlish data structure (using
references to arrays of references etc. as deep as specified by $dim).

The playground $p, and offset/dim/format arguments have the same sense
as for other handlers.  If $in is not defined, the "external" layer of
the extracted data is put into elements of array @a (so if $dim is 1,
elements of @a are numbers; if it is 2, elements are references to
arrays of numbers, etc); if $in is TRUE, the returned value is a
scalar containing an array reference (so if dim is 1, $a[0] contains a
reference to an array of numbers, etc).

If $in is an array reference, then instead of putting the "external"
layer of Perlish array into @a, it is put into the referenced array.
The fortune of existing elements of the referenced array is governed
by $keep; if FALSE, the existing content is removed; if TRUE; the
returned data is appended after the end of existing data.


=head2 Naming conventions for handlers

There are 4 types of handlers: I<accessors>, and I<modifying handlers>
(with 0,1,2 sources).  For modifying handlers, the argument which is
write-only or read-write is called C<target>, and the read-only
arguments are I<sources>.

Perl functions for conversion from C<Numeric::LL_Array> arrays to
Perl arrays are called C<access_T>; here C<T> is the letter of pack() specifier
corresponding to I<native> C type (e.g., to access native C C<signed long> one
uses pack() specifier C<"l!">; since C<!> means I<native>, we drop it,
and use C<access_l>).

Perl functions which modify one array and take no source are named
<T0_type>; here C<T> is a letter encoding the flavor, and C<type> is
the identifier describing the semantic of the function (the
corresponding C or Perl operator is put below, when it is different):

  negate flip_sign bit_complement incr decr 0   1   2  m1
  !      -         ~              ++   --   0   1   2  -1

  abs cos sin tan acos asin atan exp log log10 sqrt cbrt ceil floor trunc rint

(If C operation takes an argument, we do C<target = OP(target)>,
otherwise C<target = OP>.) For example, to increment C<signed char>
array, one uses the function named C<c0_incr>; to assign -1 to
all elements of long double array, use C<D0_m1>.  (The operations in the
second row (except abs) are implemented only for floating point types.)

Perl functions which use one array ("source") to modify another ("target")
are named <S2T1_type>; here C<T> is a letter encoding the target flavor, and
C<S> encodes the source flavor.  C<type> is the identifier describing the
semantic of the function:

  cos sin tan acos asin atan exp

(only for floating point types, and only with target type equal to source type),
or C<assign> for assignment (possibly with type conversion), or

  plus_assign   minus_assign   mult_assign   div_assign   remainder_assign
  +=            -=             *=            /=           %=

  lshift_assign  rshift_assign  pow_assign   bitand_assign bit(x)or_assign
  <<=            >>=            **=          &=            |=  ^=

  negate flip_sign bit_complement ne0 abs ceil floor trunc rint log log10 sqrt cbrt

(The C<ceil floor trunc rint> are supported only for floating-point source
types; the last two only if your C compiler defines them [most do].)
C<ne0> checks for a value to be non-0.  Semantic of function names
C<abs ceil floor trunc rint log log10 sqrt cbrt frexp modf> coincides with one
of the corresponding C functions.

For example, to convert C<unsigned long> array to a C<long double> array,
one uses the function named C<L2D1_assign>.

Likewise, Perl functions which use two arrays ("source1" and "source2") to
modify another ("target") are named <sS2T2_type>; here C<T> is a letter
encoding the target flavor, C<s> and C<S> encode the source1 and source2
flavors correspondingly.  C<type> is the identifier describing the
semantic of the function:

  plus minus mult div remainder pow lt gt le ge eq ne lshift rshift
  bitand bitor bitxor

Operations C<lt gt le ge eq ne> work as "in mathematics", not "as in C":
a negative number is less than a non-negative, even if one type is signed,
another unsigned.  (However, currently a comparison of C<long> and C<double>
goes through automatic C conversion C<long -E<gt> double>.  On some machines
long has more bits than than mantissa of a double, so this includes rounding
a C<long> to the nearest fitting C<double>.)

One can also use C<sproduct> for the operation C<target += source1 *
source2>.  The target type must coincide with one of the source types,
except for C<mult> and C<sproduct>, where additionally "wider types" 
(implemented types in C<f d D q Q>) are supported, and comparison operations
C<lt gt le ge eq ne>, where the target may additionally be of any integer type.

If source1 or target are floating point, C<lshift> and C<rshift> operations
accept negative arguments; additionally, no truncation is performed (including
negative C<lshift> and positive C<rshift>).  Likewise for C<lshift_assign>,
C<rshift_assign>.

For example, to add C<signed short> array and C<unsigned int>
and write the result to a C<unsigned long> array, one uses the function named
C<sI2L2_add>.  (Read this as I<signed short and unsigned integer TO unsigned
long: add[ition] [with 2 sources]>.)

In short: the number before underscore is the number of "source" arrays,
and the flavors of source arrays preceed the (first) number C<2> in the name.

B<Exceptional handlers>: 2 additional handlers are provided (for C<frexp modf>);
they take 1 source and 2 targets.  They should be called exactly as handlers
with 2 sources and 1 target, only the second target takes place of the second
source.

=head2 Order of operations

When an operation is performed, the cycle is run over the elements of the
array; the innermost loop is w.r.t. the first index (i.e., the first of
strides and the first of limits), and outermost is w.r.t. the last index.

The start element of the array is processed first, then the order of elements
processed is governed by the strides.  For example, suppose that $arr with 1
index consists of 0s; let $arr_f be format of $arr but with 1 less element,
$off is the offset of the next element of $arr (=stride), and $ones consists
of 1s (with format $ones_f), then

  sS2s2_add($arr, $ones, $arr, 0, 0, $offset, $dim, $arr_f, $ones_f, $arr_f);

will initialize $arr so that C<n>th element is equal to C<n>.  Indeed, the
target is $arr with offset 1; so the first addition will assign 0th element + 1
to the 1st element of $arr; after this the first 2 elements of $arr are
"correctly" initialized to 0 and 1.  The second addition will assign 1st
element + 1 to the 2nd element, so it would become 2, etc.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.

All handlers are exportable.  So are constants for Perl pack() "type
letter" for each flavor of the array:

  packId_format    packId_star_format
  packId_T         packId_star_T

here C<T> is a flavor specifier for a type used by this module.

The functions on the left return the letter, on the right return a letter
followed by C<*>.  For example, packId_L() would return C<L!> on newer
Perls, and a suitable substitute on the older ones.  The functions on
top return the pack() letter(s) for pack()ing the offsets and strides in the
array.

To simplify developing code which works with different numeric types,
one can create I<aliases> for types by putting C<:T=t> into import list.
After this word, the imported symbols may have C<T> put instead of C<t>.  E.g.,

  use Numeric::LL_Array qw( :X=d access_X XX2X2_add packId_X );
  ...
  XX2X2_add(...);

(After this, use only the type C<X> to access doubles.  If you want to replace
C<double>s by C<float>s, all you need to do is to change one letter: make
alias into C<:X=f>.)

Additionally, functions C<packId($t)>, C<packId_star($t)> are
available; they take type letter (or C<'format'>) as a parameter.

=head2 Build methodology

C functions implementing the handlers of this module are collected into
four I<dictionaries>: for accessors, and for 0-, 1- and 2-sources
modifiers.  Each dictionary is compiled from the C code in one minuscule
C file, F<code_*.h>; this file is loaded multiple times, once per handler,
with a handful of macros describing the operation to perform on each
array element, and C types of array elements.

Each dictionary corresponds to one I<constant wrapper> C file, F<driver_*.c>;
this wrapper contains no C code, only a few preprocessor directives to
include the necessary headers, and the I<autogenerated loader>, F<driver_*.h>.
The loaders are generated by a small Perl script, F<write_driver.pl>;
for each handler, a loader defines necessary macros, and includes the
corresponding file F<code_*.h>.

The memory overhead, and the initial slowdown to define thousands of
XSUBs wrapping the C handlers would be quite measurable.  To avoid
this, at start no handler XSUBs are defined.  What I<is> defined is
four I<XSUB interfaces>; they are "closure XSUBs" (or "interfaces"): to
make them into a real, callable, XSUB, one needs to attach to the interface
the corresponding dictionary entry.  So one extra XSUB is defined which does
such an attachment.

So one can define a handler XSUB for by either calling a convenient
Perl routine create_handler() (which wrapps low-level attacher XSUB),
or by just import()ing the handler (the import()er would call
create_handler() as needed) as in

  use Numeric::LL_Array qw( access_i  c2S1_assign );

So the build architecture consists of:

  an import()er which creates handler XSUBs on the fly;

  an attacher which converts interface-XSUBs into handler XSUBs;

  interface-XSUBs which call entries in the dictionary;

  dictionaries created by F<write_driver.pl> from code in F<code_*.h>.

So the total complexity of this module is about 200 lines of C code,
450 lines of Perl, and 400 lines of XSUB (including some code for testing
and developing).

=head1 HINTS

=head2 Avoiding extraneous copying

This module deals with large memory buffers.  In Perl, passing arguments
to subroutines does not involve copying the memory buffers of string
arguments.  However, the common construction

  my $arg1 = shift;

I<does> involve copying of memory buffers.

So there are two ways to create Perl subroutines which do not do extraneous
copying: first (ugly) way: access arguments as C<$_[N]>.  Second way: change
the signature of Perl subroutines: they should take playgrounds as references,
and dereference them only when passing to handlers.

  sub foo ($) { my $pg = shift; ...  d0_sin $$pg, ...

  ...
  foo \$playground;

=head2 Using extra dimensions

Consider a problem of convolving two arrays C<A>, C<B> of sizes C<a>
and C<b> with C<a E<gt> b>; the result is an array of size C<a+b-1> which
has C<RES[k] = SUM A[k-t] B[t]> (here k changes between C<b-1> and C<a-1>,
and summation runs over t between 0 and C<b-1>).  To conform to API of
this module, change indices of the result to C<0..a-b>.

Then one can calculate this by

  Assign 0 to RES
  Do sproduct() with target RES', and sources A', B'

Here C<RES', A', B'> are arrays C<RES, A, B> with an added "fake" dimension.
Assume that strides of C<A, B, RES> are 1; then the strides of C<A'> are C<1,-1>,
of C<B'> are C<0,1>, and of C<RES'> are C<1,0>, and the start position of A'
is shifted to correspond to C<A[b-1]>.

One can immediately modify this to handle multi-dimensional convolution.
Moreover, sometimes one can modify this to handle some sparse array
configurations.  For example, suppose that C<B> is the Laplace kernel

  0  1 0
  1 -4 1
  0  1 0

and C<A> is an array of size C<l x m>.  Then the result is of size
C<l-2 x m-2>, and can be calculated as:

  Make an array mFOUR of size 1 with content -4.
    Make an array mFOUR' of size l x m with the same buffer, and strides 0,0
  Make an array ONE of size 1 with content 1.
    Make an array ONE' of size l x m x 2 x 2 with the same buffer,
    and strides 0,0,0,0
  RES = A * mFOUR	(pointwise multiplication)
  Do sproduct() with target RES', and sources A', ONE'

Here C<RES'> has strides C<1,l,0,0> (we assume that C<A> has strides C<1,l>),
size C<l-2 x m-2 x 2 x 2>, while C<A'> has strides C<1,l,-l+1,l+1>, and
starts at position of index [l,0] of C<A>.

Essentially, we treat the middle C<4> of C<B> separately, and note that
the remaining C<1>s form a square.  (In fact, a parallelogram instead
of a square would be fine too.)  When "positioned" on top of C<A>, this square
has one side going up-right (which gives a stride C<-l+1>), another down-right
(which gives a stride C<l+1>) - these are strides of the "extra" two dimensions
of C<A'>.

Note that to calculate contribution of C<1>s into convolution, one needs to
do C<4(a-2)(b-2)> multiplications, and this is exactly the total size of C<A'>.
So the calculation above makes no unneeded multiplications (e.g., C<0>s
in corners of C<B> are completely ignored).  (Of course,
by breaking the steps into C<a-2 x b-2 x 2 x 2>, we do some extra
store/retrieve operations - comparing to doing straightforward convolution.
But these operations are done in C, where they are much cheaper than in Perl.)

         (need src casts...)
 NEED: min/max; with signed/vs/unsigned solved ???  min_assign??? argmin() ?
 NEED: How to find first elt which breaks conditions (as in a[n+1] == a[n]+1???
 NEED: more intelligent choice of accessors for q/Q and D (newsvpv?)...
 NEED: accessor to long double max-aligned (to 16 when size is between 8 and 16)
 NEED: long vs double comparison? char-vs-quad comparison? cmp?
 NEED: pseudo-flavor: k-th coordinate of the index (or a linear combination?)
 NEED: All flavors of FFT
 NEED: Indirect access (use value of one array as index in another)
 NEED: A lot of testers run out of memory already compiling 1arg; 2arg is
	3x as large.  To split them, we need also to split the logic
	to look up the tables...
		(Might find_in_ftable() (return (index << 2) | which_table)?)

BSD misses many C<long double> APIs (elementary functions, trunc(), rint()
shifts, and C<**>).
So when deciding whether one wants to do operations over C<long double>s,
one should either check for presence of the needed functions (by doing
C<eval "use Numeric::LL_Array 'D0_sin'; 1"> or some such), or check
return value of elementary_D_missing().

Some C environments miss trunc() (and maybe rint()?  Did not see it missing).
In such cases the corresponding handlers are not defined.  If you know how
to work around, but want to use trunc() if present, one can check for this
using eval(), as above, with handlers C<d0_trunc>, C<d0_rint>.

In C Integer Conversion to signed type and floating to integer
conversion are implementation-specific unless the (truncated) value can be
represented exactly.  Hence, e.g., operations with C<unsigned int> and C<signed
int> targets need different C implementations (they do not necessarily differ
by integer conversion, which is a NOP on in-memory representations).  Which
means that we need C code to all all the flavors, and our (autogenerated) C
code is quite bulky and takes a lot of time to compile.

=head1 Possible future

What is needed is hide-the-flavors higher-level wrapper which
automatically chooses handlers basing on flavors of arguments.  Yet
another hiding level would create an overloaded-operation 

Possible layout of an object:
   RV:		playground
   IV:		flavor, dim
   PV:		format

Need also a region of playground one can write when targetting this
value.

This may give a significant slowdown in the case of smallish arrays.
Then maybe a "precompile" step may be useful: another class; operations
over this class do not do calculations, but just name/type resolution,
and bound checks.  While operations are performed, this information
is stored in a "program buffer".  Then one can invoke the "program
buffer" (assumingly inside a cycle, otherwise there is no point
in doing preprocessing in advance); this should suit iterative methods...

Tentative example of how it might be accessed:

  my $prog = new Numeric::LL_Program_Array;
  my $playground = ...;
  my $p = new Numeric::Array_for_Program $prog, $playground, 'd', $min, $max,
					 $start, $dims = [1, 2*$N+1, 1];
  my $one = $p->subarray(0, $dims = [1, $N, 0]); # dim=1, off=0, stride = 0
  my $a   = $p->subarray(1, $dims = [1, $N, 1]); # dim=1, off=1, stride = 1
  my $tmp = $p->subarray($N+1, $dims = [1, $N, 1]); # after $a

  my $one1 = $one->subarray(0, $dims = [1, 1,  0]); # occupies the same place
  $one1->assign_1;		# assigns $one too

  my $a00 = $a->subarray(0, $dims = [1, 1, 1]); # The first element
  $a00->assign_0;
  my $a0 = $a->subarray(0, $dims = [1, $N-1, 1]); # all but last element
  my $a1 = $a->subarray(1, $dims = [1, $N-1, 1]); # all but first element
  $a1->assign_add($one, $a0);	# Now $a has elements 0..$N-1

  $prog->invoke_and_clean;	# Execute once, forget, start accumulate again

  $tmp->assign_tan($a);
  $a->subtract_assign($tmp);

  $prog->invoke for 0..19;	# run 20 iterations of x = x - tan(x) 
  print($a);

(need also flavors of subarray which modify $min/$max?).  Note that subarray()
does not touch the playground, only the dim/offsets/strides data.
