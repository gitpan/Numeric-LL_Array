Numeric-LL_Array version 0.01
==========================

For unsigned int/long, *_abs first converts to signed variant, then takes abs().

~, <<, >>, and % do not allow floating-point source and/or target types.

Transcendental functions are defined only with the same source type and target
types, both floating-point.

Binary operations are defined only for target type being one of the source types.

Dot product operation: targ += s1 * s2.

NEED: product with wider target; same for lshift...
	(need src casts...)
NEED: modf, ldexp, frexp (all take *l), cbrt...
NEED: min/max ???  min_assign???
NEED: How to find first elt which breaks conditions (as in a[n+1] == a[n]+1???
NEED: more intelligent choice of accessors for q/Q and D...
NEED: accessor to long double max-aligned (to 16 when size is between 8 and 16)
NEED: abs() for long long?
NEED: signed vs unsigned comparison? char-vs-quad comparison? cmp?
NEED: pseudo-flavor: k-th coordinate of the index

DONE: creation of Perl funcs undoing our econimizing on C level...
DONE: ceil, floor, trunc, rint (all take *l)
DONE: comparison 
DONE: accessors, >, == etc
DONE: remove duplicate flavors for commutative 2-arg operations...
DONE: make methods static
DONE: skip duplicate sizes (such as int/long may be)...
DONE: skip duplicate commutative (first size never larger than the second)...
DONE: packId_star_format

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

A fully working Perl installation.  Since vendor-supplied installations
most of the time are not "fully working", Perl's which are not compiled
on the machine in question are not supported (unless you can prove you
know what you are talking about).

[It may take a pretty large amount of memory and time to compile the
 C files used by this module.  Expect needs of about 512MB of memory,
 and minutes of time on even on fast hardware of 2009.]
