Revision history for Perl extension Numeric::LL_Array.

0.01  Wed Nov 30 17:55:12 2005
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-b 5.8.7 -Afn Numeric::Array

	First (stubbish) accessor works.

0.02
	Regularization of internal typing/field naming system.
	Real accessors work.
	0-arg methods work.

0.03
	1-arg, 2-arg methods implemented (minimally tested only).
	Semantic of playgrounds, strides and formats documented.
	Naming convention of the functions documented.
	The 0, invalid, entry in the dispatch table modified to cause
	  croak(), not segfault.
	Avoid creation of XSUBs referencing the invalid 0 entry.
	Accessors for Perl format letters for internally used types.
	More reasonable docs.
	typemap added.
	Clean headers for types and unused functions.
	Check with Perl v>= 5.00553, and with threads.

0.04
	Lists of supported handlers provided.
	Remove defaults for arguments in 0- 1- 2-arg handlers.
	Misprint in lookup of 1-arg handlers.
	Hint about passing by reference.

0.05
	checkfit() did not check for negative (and 0!) counts
	checkfit() did not match semantic of source sizes
	Beginning of framework for 2dim multi-grid (does not treat
		boundary conditions well enough, so convergence is slower
		than expected).
	We take into account that long double is broken under BSD;
		elementary functions over `D' argument are not supported
		if elementary_D_missing() is TRUE; currently
  cos sin tan acos asin atan exp log log10 sqrt ceil floor trunc rint pow.
	Hints on implementation of convolution.
